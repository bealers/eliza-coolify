# ElizaOS Coolify Deployment Project - Completion PRD

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** ElizaOS Coolify Deployment Complete
**Status:** Phase 3 - Multi-Mode Deployment Validation & Repository Preparation
**Objective:** Deliver a production-ready ElizaOS deployment solution for Coolify with comprehensive documentation and testing across all deployment modes.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Confirmed Working
- **Local Dev Mode:** ElizaOS runs successfully with Server Bod character
- **Infrastructure:** Docker containers, PostgreSQL with pgvector, networking
- **Configuration:** Character files, environment setup, build processes
- **Coolify Platform:** 99% confidence in production infrastructure components

### ❌ Needs Validation/Fixing
- **Local Start Mode:** Untested - production-like local environment
- **Docker Production Mode:** Entity formatting errors blocking chat responses
- **Documentation:** Incomplete for end-user deployment
- **Repository Quality:** Not yet ready for Eliza team presentation

## Success Criteria

1. **Three Deployment Modes Working:**
   - Local dev mode (✅ confirmed)
   - Local start mode (needs testing)
   - Coolify production mode (needs debugging)

2. **Repository Excellence:**
   - Professional documentation
   - Clear deployment guides
   - Working examples and tests
   - Clean codebase ready for Eliza team review

3. **Production Reliability:**
   - Chat responses working in all modes
   - Error handling and monitoring
   - Performance optimization
   - Security best practices

## Target Audience

**Primary:** ElizaOS community members wanting to deploy on Coolify
**Secondary:** Eliza core team evaluating this as an official resource
**Stakeholders:** DevOps engineers, AI developers, production deployment teams

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- ElizaOS chat agent responding correctly in all deployment modes
- WebSocket/Socket.IO real-time communication working
- Database persistence and retrieval functioning
- OpenAI API integration stable across environments
- Character loading and personality consistency

### Deployment Architecture
- **Local Dev:** `elizaos dev` with full debugging and hot reload
- **Local Start:** `elizaos start` mimicking production environment locally
- **Coolify Production:** Docker-based deployment with proper scaling and monitoring

### Infrastructure Components
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings, note slim version is behind non slim, once non slim works we have to test slim spearatetly. 
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Environment variable management
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
- Chat response time: < 3 seconds for OpenAI API calls
- WebSocket connection establishment: < 1 second
- Database query response: < 500ms for typical operations
- Container startup time: < 30 seconds
- Memory usage: < 1GB per container under normal load

### Security Requirements
- API keys properly secured and not exposed in logs
- HTTPS/SSL enforcement in production
- Database connections encrypted
- Input validation for chat messages
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

### Compatibility Requirements
- ElizaOS requirements (node 23.3 & Bun)
- Coolify platform compatibility


## Detailed Feature Specifications

- API response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring and alerting

**Operational Excellence**
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Container restart policies
- Database migration scripts
- Backup automation
- Configuration management

## Known Issues to Resolve

### High Priority
1. **Entity Formatting Errors:** `core::prompts:formatPosts - no entity for [UUID]` in Docker
2. **Environment Variable Handling:** Differences between local and containerized environments
3. **Logging Verbosity:** Production mode too quiet for debugging

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation Gaps:** Missing deployment screenshots and examples
2. **Error Recovery:** Need better handling of temporary API failures
3. **Performance Tuning:** Container resource optimization

### Low Priority
1. **UI Polish:** Minor web interface improvements
2. **Additional Characters:** More example character configurations
3. **Advanced Features:** Optional integrations and plugins

## Delivery Timeline

**Phase 1:** Multi-Mode Validation (Priority: High)
- Test local start mode functionality
- Debug Docker production mode issues
- Validate all three deployment paths

**Phase 2:** Repository Preparation (Priority: High)
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Clean up codebase and configuration
- Add testing and validation tools

**Phase 3:** Quality Assurance (Priority: Medium)

*** IMPORTANT RULES  ***
- WE are building MVP first. Yes we ship secure and tested, but lets ship quicky too. 
- DO NOT OVERCOOK testing get working system first
- DO NOT OVERCOOK user documentation, just record dev insights for now
- no task numbers or hyperbole in commit messages
- ONLY ESSENTIAL EMOJIS ANYWHERE FOR ANY REASON

This PRD represents the completion of a production-ready ElizaOS deployment solution that the Eliza community can confidently use and the core team can evaluate as an official resource.
